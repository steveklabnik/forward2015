# Forward 2015

This is my talk for Forward 2015.

## What?

This repository contains 3 interwoven projects:

- `rust`: a regular expression proram written in Rust
- `rsgex`: a regular expression library written in node that uses the `rust` program (see above)
- `node`: a node application that demostrates both the npm library `Regex` and the `rsgex` Rust/node regular expression library (see above)

## Prerequisites

- Rust [(download)](http://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Node [(download)](https://nodejs.org/)
